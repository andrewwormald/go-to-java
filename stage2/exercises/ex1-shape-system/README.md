# Exercise 1: Shape Drawing System

## Goal
Master interfaces, implementation, and polymorphism in Java.

## What You'll Build
A drawing system that works with different shapes through a common interface.

## Requirements
Complete the interface and shape classes:
1. `Shape` interface with area, perimeter, and draw methods
2. `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle` implementations
3. Demonstrate polymorphism with shape arrays

## Expected Output
```
=== Shape System Test ===
Drawing Circle: radius=5.0
Area: 78.54, Perimeter: 31.42

Drawing Rectangle: 4.0x6.0
Area: 24.00, Perimeter: 20.00

Drawing Triangle: sides=3.0,4.0,5.0
Area: 6.00, Perimeter: 12.00

âœ… All tests passed!
```

## Key Concepts
- Interface definition and implementation
- Polymorphism with interface references
- Method implementation across different classes
- Math calculations in Java

## Time Estimate
45-60 minutes

## Run Your Solution
```bash
javac *.java && java ExampleTest
