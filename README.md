## Key Differences: Go vs Java

| Concept | Java | Go |
|---------|------|-----|
| **OOP** | Class-based inheritance | Interface-based composition |
| **Error Handling** | Exceptions (try/catch) | Explicit error returns |
| **Memory Management** | Garbage collected | Garbage collected + manual |
| **Generics** | Type erasure, wildcards | Type parameters, constraints |
| **Concurrency** | Threads, synchronized | Goroutines, channels |
| **Packaging** | Packages, imports | Modules, packages |
