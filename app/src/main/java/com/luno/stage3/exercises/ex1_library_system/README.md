# Exercise 1: Library Management System

## Goal
Practice using ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and TreeMap for different use cases.

## What You'll Build
A simple library system that manages books and provides search functionality.

1. Store books in an ArrayList
2. Enable ISBN lookup with HashMap
3. Track unique authors with HashSet
4. Count books by genre with TreeMap
